 <p>According to occult lore, the Nine Unknown Men are a two millennia-old secret society founded by the Indian Emperor Asoka 273 BC. 
    The society was founded after Asoka won the battle of Kalinga and at the sight of the death of 100,000 lost in the battle, resolved to follow the path of non violence.
    He converted to Buddhism after the massacre, the Emperor founded the society of the Nine to preserve and develop knowledge that would be dangerous to humanity if it fell into the wrong hands. It is said that the Emperor Asoka once aware of the horrors of war, wished to forbid men ever to put their intelligence to evil uses. During his reign natural science, past and present, was vowed to secrecy. 
    Henceforward, and for the next 2,000 years, all researches, ranging from the structure of matter to the techniques employed in collective psychology, were to be hidden behind the mystical mask of a people commonly believed to be exclusively concerned with ecstasy and supernatural phenomena. 
    Each of the Nine is supposedly responsible for guarding and improving a single book which includes materials or subjects like propaganda, psychological warfare, physiology, microbiology, communication, gravitation, cosmogony. Nobody knows where the book is and these nine men are or if these claims are just a mindful hoax. </p>

    <h3>Myth or Fact</h3>
<p>It is difficult to imagine that an ancient society has continued to exist in secrecy for more than 2000 years, influencing global events from the deep jungles of India, with no infrastructure, technology, or equipment. So it's up to us to decide whether the current existence of the society is a myth or fact</p>
